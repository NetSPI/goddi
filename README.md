## Install

`go install github.com/swarley7/goddi`

Or, 

```
git clone https://github.com/swarley7/goddi.git
cd goddi
go install
```    

### Windows

Tested on Windows 10 and 8.1 (go1.10 windows/amd64).

### Linux

Tested on Kali Linux (go1.10 linux/amd64).

- umount, mount, and cifs-utils need to be installed for mapping a share for GetGPP
```
apt-get update
apt-get install -y mount cifs-utils
```
- make sure nothing is mounted at /mnt/goddi/
- make sure to run with `sudo`

### Darwin

Tested on Darwin 17.5.0 (go1.10.1 darwin/amd64)

- make sure nothing is mounted at /mnt/goddi/
- make sure to run with `sudo`

## Run

When run, will default to using TLS (tls.Client method) over 636. On Linux, make sure to run with `sudo`.

- username: Target user. Required parameter.
- password: Target user's password. Required parameter.
- domain: Full domain name. Required parameter.
- dc: DC to target. Can be either an IP or full hostname. Required parameter.
- startTLS: Use to StartTLS over 389.
- unsafe: Use for a plaintext connection.

```

## Functionality

StartTLS and TLS (tls.Client func) connections supported. Connections over TLS are default. All output goes to CSVs and are created in /csv/ in the current working directory. Dumps:

- Domain users. Also searches Description for keywords and prints to a seperate csv ex. "Password" was found in the domain user description.
- Users in priveleged user groups (DA, EA, FA).
- Users with passwords not set to expire.
- User accounts that have been locked or disabled.
- Machine accounts with passwords older than 45 days.
- Domain Computers.
- Domain Controllers.
- Sites and Subnets.
- SPNs and includes csv flag if domain admin (a flag to note SPNs that are DAs in the SPN CSV output).
- Trusted domain relationships.
- Domain Groups.
- Domain OUs.
- Domain Account Policy.
- Domain deligation users.
- Domain GPOs.
- Domain FSMO roles.
- LAPS passwords.
- GPP passwords. On Windows, defaults to mapping Q. If used, will try another mapping until success R, S, etc... On Linux, /mnt/goddi is used.

## Roadmap

- Add support for running from current user context on Windows. Automatically get current domain and run in current user context.
- Add robust error handling for GetGPP (net use and mount)
- Improve XML parsing for GetGPP

## Known Issues

- Execution can fail at GetGPP if there are errors mapping a share or mounting /mnt/goddi. If goddi fails during GetGPP do the following checks.
    - Windows: check what shares are mounted with `net use`. If there is a share mounted to the target dc from goddi, remove it with `net use Q: /delete` where Q: is the problematic share.
    - Linux: check if /mnt/goddi exists. If something is mounted, use `umount /mnt/goddi`. Make sure goddi is run with sudo.
